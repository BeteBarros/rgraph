RGraph: Beautiful javascript charts for websites
================================================


RGraph is an Open Source JavaScript charts library for websites. It was started in 2008 and was initially canvas only.

Now it has support for over 60 responsive chart types across SVG and canvas, multiple data source import capability (including Google Sheets), animations, JSON and AJAX support and more besides. RGraph is licensed under the MIT llicense.


RGraph was first created in 2008 and used canvas and was only moved on to GitHub in 2021. It's not a full migration by any means - the repository will be updated with each new release. As my familiarity with GitHub grows it will become more and more tied to it and will use it as it is intended.
